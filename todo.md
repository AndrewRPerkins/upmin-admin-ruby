# V2 Beta Release

- [ ] Clean up the code (a lot)!
  - [ ] Nodes should probably be replaced. They aren't really necessary in the current version and could be replaced with a nice clean implementation of `Upmin::Model` and `Upmin::ModelInstance`

  - [ ] Things like `product_id` probably shouldn't be shown on forms when the relation is shown as well.

  - [ ] Add a way to update associations with more than just an id. Maybe a modal that you can search for or create a model instance.

  - [ ] All the search things need to be more extensible.
    - [ ] Search boxes need to be more extensible.
    - [ ] Search fields need to be more extensible.
    - [ ] Search results need to be more extensible.

  - [ ] Needs more :cow: :bell:
